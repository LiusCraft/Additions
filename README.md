# Additions
This mod lets you add your own items, blocks, and more to the game without writing any code!

It has a dependency on [Loot Overhaul](https://github.com/Tmtravlr/LootOverhaul)

## Using this as a library in another mod
This mod is still in progress, so I haven't made any deobf versions yet.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the code, you can create a pull request, and I'll review it when I have a chance. =)
